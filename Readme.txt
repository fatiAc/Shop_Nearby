The following application is developed using Java Entreprise Edition, I specifically used ejb as a server architecture and JSF as a view technology. As for the data I used a mysql database which I filled randomly, the said database is included in the code.
The application implemented all the functionalities specified in the coding challenge guidelines which are the following:
•	 A sign-up page for the user by email and password.
•	A sign-in page for the user by email and password.
•	A Nearby Shops page displaying a list of shops sorted by distance.
•	A My preferred Shops page displaying liked shops.
•	A like button adding a shop into my preferred shops list.
•	A remove button to remove a shop from my preferred shops list.
•	A dislike button.
